# **What is Cryptography?**
    
Cryptography is taking some readable data and converting it into unreadable data through a cryptographic algorithm. Obviously, there is little point converting the data unless there was some method to convert it back into readable data.

**Cryptography** is the study of information hiding and verification. It includes the protocols, algorithms and strategies to securely and consistently prevent or delay unauthorized access to sensitive information and enable verifiability of every component in a communication.

Cryptography is derived from the Greek words: kryptós, "hidden", and gráphein, "to write" - or "hidden writing". People who study and develop cryptography are called **cryptographers**. The study of how to *circumvent* the use of cryptography for unintended recipients is called **cryptanalysis**, or codebreaking. Cryptography and cryptanalysis are sometimes grouped together under the **umbrella** term cryptology, encompassing the entire subject. In practice, "cryptography" is also often used to refer to the field as a whole, especially as an applied science. At the dawn of the 21 century in an ever more interconnected and technological world cryptography started to be ubiquitous as well as the reliance on the benefits it brings, especially the increased security and verifiability.

Cryptography is an interdisciplinary subject, drawing from several fields. Before the time of computers, it was closely related to linguistics. Nowadays the emphasis has shifted, and cryptography makes extensive use of technical areas of mathematics, especially those areas collectively known as discrete mathematics. This includes topics from number theory, information theory, computational complexity, statistics and combinatorics. It is also a branch of engineering, but an unusual one as it must deal with active, intelligent and malevolent opposition.

An example of the sub-fields of cryptography is **steganography** — the study of hiding the very *existence* of a message, and not necessarily the *contents* of the message itself (for example, microdots, or invisible ink) — and **traffic analysis**, which is the analysis of patterns of communication in order to learn secret information.

When information is transformed from a *useful form* of understanding to an *opaque form* of understanding, this is called **encryption**. When the information is reverted back into a useful form, it is called **decryption**. Intended recipients or authorized use of the information is determined by whether the user has a certain piece of secret knowledge. *Only* users with the secret knowledge can transform the opaque information back into its useful form. The secret knowledge is commonly called the **key**, though the secret knowledge may include the *entire process* or algorithm that is used in the encryption/decryption. The information in its useful form is called **plaintext** (or cleartext); in its encrypted form it is called **ciphertext**. The algorithm used for encryption and decryption is called a **cipher** (or cypher).

# **Cipher**

A cipher is an **algorithm** for performing encryption and decryption.

❓ An algorithm is a series of steps to complete a goal.
