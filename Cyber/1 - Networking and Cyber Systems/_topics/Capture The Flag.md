# What are CTF Games?

> Cyber Security Capture the Flag (CTF) games are essentially puzzles and challenges designed to test your cybersecurity skills. They function like a real-world simulation, where you try to find hidden clues or data (flags) by using cybersecurity tools and techniques.
These games come in various formats and difficulty levels, making them perfect for anyone from beginners to seasoned professionals. Here's a breakdown of what CTF games are all about:
**The Goal:**
Your objective in a CTF game is to locate these hidden flags. Flags can be strings of text, encoded messages, or files.
Finding them requires you to solve problems that test your knowledge of various cybersecurity domains like cryptography, web security, and digital forensics.
