# Stepper Motors

These motors are used for greater control over how far the motor turns. Using high amounts of torque, it can 'step' to the next position.

Stepper motors fall somewhere in between a regular DC motor and a servo motor. They have the advantage that they can be positioned accurately, moved forward or backwards one 'step' at a time, but they can also rotate continuously.
