# Motors

[There are different types of motors which can be used for different projects](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.sparkfun.com%2Ftutorials%2Fmotors-and-selecting-the-right-one&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEUPlpTwx9lqZL46oPp61ErnwjNeA). There are three main categories of motors - DC Motors, Servos and Steppers

| ------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DC Motors** | ![[componentsMotorDC.jpg]]      | Needs a Motor Controller and external power. Can be wired either way. Speed Controlled by PWM |
| **Servos**    | ![[componentMotorsServo.png]]   | Usually 180° or 360° mobility. Can jump straight to a particular angle.                       |
| **Stepper**   | ![[componentMotorsStepper.jpg]] | Slow moving, but holds position when power is lost.                                           |

Depending on the motor you have access to, you will need to wire them differently to your controller. You will need to google the model number and wire it appropriately.
